	<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
	<p>
		The love and appreciation of music and the arts is one of the greatest gifts that we can give to each other. Learning music includes attaining the discipline to master a skill as well as a new language. This is a skill that (unlike many physical skills) is life-long and actually increases throughout a lifetime. Most importantly, learning to make music with others is a joy unlike any other. In addition to gaining an appreciation of music, lifelong friendships are often made through musical ensembles, bands and orchestras. I have been able to share my love of music for the past 24 years throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. There is nothing else that is as rewarding and fulfilling than seeing the enjoyment of music in the eyes of students.

	<h2>Message for students and parents:</h2>
	<p>
		Choosing an instrument and playing in a band that the student enjoys is the key to the child’s willingness to practice regularly. Good eye-hand coordination is crucial to any instrument (especially the flute) so care must be taken to pay attention to details (posture, hand position, breath support etc) at all times when practicing. Remember, playing any instrument is hard work at first but the rewards are great for the student that does not give up and to reach the performance level.
