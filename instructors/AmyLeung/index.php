<h1> Artist: Amy D. Leung </h1>

<article>
	Amy D. Leung is a graduate of Pratt Institute, New York (one of the top art colleges<br />
	in the U.S.) and has since worked in advertising, publishing companies and fine art<br />
	studios full-time for more than ten years. She loves painting. Twenty years ago, she<br />
	started full time painting at her own art studio. She studied oil painting and figure<br />
	drawing with a number of art masters in the U.S., Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei,<br />
	and Geneva where she lived for a while. Now, Amy is a highly-regarded independent<br />
	fine art professional. She has won best of class, founder’s awards…many awards in<br />
	juried art shows both nationally as well as in local communities.<br />
	Amy’s paintings have been juried into prestigious art shows: American Women<br />
	Artist, the National Oil and Acrylic Painters Society (NOAPS), Oil Painters of<br />
	America Western Regional (OPA) and Salon International. Her paintings are in<br />
	private collections both in the U.S. and overseas.<br />
	Her favorite subject matters are landscape, cityscape, seascape, still life and<br />
	animals. Amy typically begins each painting with a strong “feeling” about the subject<br />
	matter. As she commits her inner thoughts to canvas, she focuses on conveying her<br />
	emotions and sensitivity about the overall visual idea, into which the central subject<br />
	is integrated. The ultimate satisfaction is to reach out and touch the viewer deeply<br />
	through her work.<br />
	From a technical perspective, Amy plays on light and colors, which offer endless<br />
	varieties and possibilities. The challenge is to bring out the unique characteristics of<br />
	the subject vividly so that it creates a striking and memorable experience.<br />
	Artist Statement:<br />
	I love teaching. I enjoy very much sharing my knowledge and teaching art to<br />
	those wonderful students at Angel Academy of the Arts. The students are very<br />
	conscientious and apply what they learn to express artistically to the best of their<br />
	ability. For me, it is immensely satisfying and fulfilling to see such motivated<br />
	students at work.<br><br><br>
