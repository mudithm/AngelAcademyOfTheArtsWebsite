<h1> Artist: Arno Chen </h1>

<article>
	Arno Nengshen Chen was born in Taiwan. He came to the US and has worked as a<br />
	graphic designer and artist in the Bay Area in 1995.<br />
	He loves drawing since very early age. He started his fine art training when he was<br />
	15 at Taiwan Xie He private Business school, and major in Fine Art and Graphic<br />
	Design (台灣協和私立工商學校美術工藝科). He continuing studied fine art at City<br />
	College of San Francisco(CCSF)after he moved to U.S. in 1996. After he obtained a<br />
	degree in Graphic Design from CCSF, he still continues to this day to take advanced<br />
	painting classes at City College to perfect his technique and further refine his artistic<br />
	style. On the role of continuing education he says: “It keeps me painting on a regular<br />
	schedule and refreshes my mind with new artistic vision from the college”.<br />
	Now, Arno is an art director at Design Firm in San Francisco. Arno has painted<br />
	many portraits on commission and enjoys still life and landscape painting as well.<br />
	In addition to being an artist, Arno is also a world traveler. He has traveled to Europe<br />
	more than 10 times and to Africa, Russia and other parts of Asia. Most recently, he<br />
	traveled to Morocco and Egypt and then to France, Italy and Greece. His passion<br />
	for traveling began when he was 22. Since graduating from college, he has travelled<br />
	abroad to other countries every year. Much of his artistic inspiration comes from<br />
	the many countries he has visited. He not only studies masterpieces in the great<br />
	museums of the world, but also visits the beautiful countryside to learn about<br />
	different cultures and art as well. “I think it is important to see as much of the world<br />
	and its people as possible–it gives you new ideas for your artwork and helps you to<br />
	understand the value and meaning of your life better”.<br />
	Arno loves teaching. He hopes he can pasts his art skills and knowledge to the<br />
	next generation. He says “Not every person will become a professional artist. Many<br />
	people do have talent in art which they should develop, not only for their personal<br />
	sense of satisfaction and accomplishment; but also to bring enjoyment to others and<br />
	make the world more colorful.”<br><br><br>
